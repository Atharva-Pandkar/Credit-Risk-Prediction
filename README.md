## Introduction
The project addresses the classification of individuals into good or bad credit risks within the financial sector. Motivated by the need for accurate credit risk assessment, this research contributes to both theoretical and practical aspects of credit risk evaluation.

## Methodology
- **Approach:** Application of various machine learning models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- **Goal:** To explore which techniques are most effective in handling financial data complexities and predicting creditworthiness.
- **Components:** Data Collection & Preprocessing, Model Development & Implementation, Performance Evaluation, and Comparative Analysis.

## Dataset
Utilizes the Statlog German Credit Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising data on 1000 loan applicants with 20 distinct attributes, including credit history, loan amount, and personal information.

## Results
- Insightful revelations into the predictive capabilities of various machine learning models.
- Visualization of correlations between attributes and model performance metrics.
- Comparative evaluations across different machine learning algorithms.

## Correlation Matrix
The correlation matrix reveals varying degrees of linear relationships between different features. The color intensity in the heatmap represents the strength of the correlation, aiding in identifying multicollinearity within the dataset.
